**Plinker-RPC - Nginx**
=========

Plinker PHP RPC client/server makes it really easy to link and execute PHP component classes on remote systems, while maintaining the feel of a local method call.

**WIP:** Dont use!

See the [organisations page](https://github.com/plinker-rpc) for additional components and examples.
